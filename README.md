### Estraverse Fork

This fork introduces a 'recur' callback beside 'enter' and 'leave'. recur is called with the parent
element between the traversal of its siblings.

Think of this simple graph:

```
  Parent
    /\
   /  \
  A    B
```
With recur, the overall sequence of traversal will be: Enter Parent, Enter A, Leave A, Recur Parent, Enter B, Leave B, Leave Parent.
This can be useful to check, wether a node is actually a grandchild or a sibling of another node, which can be hard to detect with
enter and leave alone.

Recur only supports BREAK. Also, within replace, recur does not support replacing or removing, only BREAK.

The rest from here on is original documentation from estraverse.

Estraverse ([estraverse](http://github.com/estools/estraverse)) is
[ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
traversal functions from [esmangle project](http://github.com/estools/esmangle).

### Documentation

You can find usage docs at [wiki page](https://github.com/estools/estraverse/wiki/Usage).

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
estraverse.traverse(ast, {
    enter: function (node, parent) {
        if (node.type == 'FunctionExpression' || node.type == 'FunctionDeclaration')
            return estraverse.VisitorOption.Skip;
    },
    leave: function (node, parent) {
        if (node.type == 'VariableDeclarator')
          console.log(node.id.name);
    }
});
```

We can use `this.skip`, `this.remove` and `this.break` functions instead of using Skip, Remove and Break.

```javascript
estraverse.traverse(ast, {
    enter: function (node) {
        this.break();
    }
});
```

And estraverse provides `estraverse.replace` function. When returning node from `enter`/`leave`, current node is replaced with it.

```javascript
result = estraverse.replace(tree, {
    enter: function (node) {
        // Replace it with replaced.
        if (node.type === 'Literal')
            return replaced;
    }
});
```

By passing `visitor.keys` mapping, we can extend estraverse traversing functionality.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
estraverse.traverse(tree, {
    enter: function (node) { },

    // Extending the existing traversing rules.
    keys: {
        // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
        TestExpression: ['argument']
    }
});
```

By passing `visitor.fallback` option, we can control the behavior when encountering unknown nodes.
```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
estraverse.traverse(tree, {
    enter: function (node) { },

    // Iterating the child **nodes** of unknown nodes.
    fallback: 'iteration'
});
```
